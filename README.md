## 📊 Sentiment Analysis using NLP

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates **Sentiment Analysis** on textual data (e.g., tweets, reviews) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

### 🚀 Project Overview

* **Goal:** Predict the sentiment (positive/negative) of text data such as reviews.
* **Dataset:** Sample IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset.
* **Techniques Used:**

  * Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
  * TF-IDF Vectorization
  * Logistic Regression Model
  * Performance Evaluation and Visualization

### 🗂️ Files

* `sentiment_analysis_notebook.ipynb` — Main notebook showcasing data preprocessing, model implementation, and insights.

### 🔍 Steps in the Notebook

1. **Load Dataset:** IMDB movie reviews dataset loaded via Pandas.
2. **Preprocessing:** Text cleaning (removing HTML tags, punctuation, lowercasing).
3. **Feature Engineering:** TF-IDF vectorization.
4. **Model Training:** Logistic Regression for sentiment classification.
5. **Evaluation:** Model accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
6. **Insights:** Model achieved \~85% accuracy. Future improvements could include using advanced models like BERT.

### 📦 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-nlp.git
   ```
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook sentiment_analysis_notebook.ipynb
   ```
3. Install required libraries (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

### 📌 Future Work

* Experiment with advanced models like BERT or RoBERTa for better performance.
* Incorporate more datasets (e.g., tweets, product reviews).
* Deploy the model as a web API for real-time predictions.
